                Inspired By Toby Fox (creator of  <a href="https://undertale.com/"> Undertale</a> ), my first game was a 3h long 2D pixelart game made in GameMaker Studio. 
                The story starts when the main character wakes up in hell - albeit a fairly pleasant corner of it - and decides that they will try to break out of it. 
                Although whether this is even possible or if your escape attempt will only make things worse is yet to be seen. <br><br>

                The game includes a branching story with interactable NPCs, quests, and mini games. The fighting system is akin to old school Zelda games and includes several
                different enemy types as well as two final bosses. However, there is also a platformer section and a kind of top-down
                arcade-style mini game. <br><br>
                The story includes themes of mental health and self-care and is available in English and Spanish.
                Please check it out on Steam.
